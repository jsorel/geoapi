/**
 * This class serves to contain one static constant, VECTOR, indicating that
 * the in-between points of a path are points on the Euclidean shortest
 * distance line between the vertices.  This line should be computed in
 * whatever "real-world" space the points live.  So for example, if the
 * points are LatLonAlts, then the shortest distance line should be computed
 * in a coordinate system such as Earth Centered Earth Fixed (ECEF).
 * <P>
 * As an example of the use of VECTOR, consider two buildings some distance
 * apart, each with a person standing on top.  If one of the people were to
 * fire a laser at the other, the beam would follow a straight path that does
 * not bend with the surface of the earth.  This straight path is what is
 * meant by VECTOR.
