/**
 * This class serves to contain two constants: 
 * <ol>
 *   <li>
 *     PIXEL_STRAIGHT, that indicates that a path between two points should
 *     be drawn on the screen as a straight line, regardless of the location 
 *     or orientation of the vertices.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *     CONTINUOUS_SPLINE, that indicates a spline is to be used to connect 
 *     points along a path.
 *   </li>
 * </ol>
 * These should be used in situations where accuracy is unimportant or the
 * appearance of the path is intended to remain the same, regardless of the
 * current viewport of the map.  Note that this applies to both
 * two dimensional and three dimensional displays; in a three dimensional
 * display, the path may cross other objects, but will always appear straight.
