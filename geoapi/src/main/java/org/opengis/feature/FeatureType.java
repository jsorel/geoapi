/**
 * Describes a feature in an application namespace. A {@code FeatureType}
 * represents features as an object that contains zero or more attribute
 * objects, one of which will generally be a geometry, but no geometry and
 * multiple geometries are allowed. Note that instances of this class are
 * henceforth referred to as schemas.
 * <p>
 * With one exception, the type of an attribute is considered to be its cannonical
 * definition by the {@code FeatureType}. For example, an attribute type might be
 * a {@code javax.sound.midi.Sequence} object, which contains a {@code float} public
 * field called {@code PPQ}. The fact that this attribute exists is not known by the
 * {@code FeatureType} itself. If a caller asks this {@code FeatureType} for all of
 * its attributes, the {@code FeatureType} will tell the caller that it has an attribute
 * of type {@code javax.sound.midi.Sequence}, but not that this attribute has a sub-attribute
 * (field) called {@code PPQ}. It is the responsibility of the callers to understand
 * the objects it is asking for and manipulate them appropriately. The sole exception
 * is if the type stored in the {@code FeatureType} is a {@link Feature} type. In this
 * case, all information about sub-attributes are stored and passed to calling classes
 * upon request. The style of reference (XPath) is defined in and mediated by
 * {@code FeatureType} implementations.
 * <p>
 * It is the responsibility of the implementing class to ensure that the {@code FeatureType}
 * is always in a valid state. This means that each attribute tuple must be fully initialized
 * and valid. The minimum valid {@code FeatureType} is one with nulls for namespace, type, and
 * attributes; this is clearly a trivial case, since it is so constrained that it would not allow
 * for any feature construction. There are a few conventions of which implementers of this interface
 * must be aware in order to successfully manage a {@code FeatureType}:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><p><b>Immutability</b><br>
 *       <em>Feature types must be implemented as immutable objects!</em></p></li>
 *
 *   <li><p><b>XPath</b><br>
 *       XPath is the standard used to access all attributes (flat, nested, and multiple),
 *       via a single, unified string. Using XPath to access attributes has the convenient
 *       side-benefit of making them appear to be non-nested and non-multiple to callers with
 *       no awareness of XPath. This greatly simplifies accessing and manipulating data. However,
 *       it does put extra burden on the implementers of {@code FeatureType} to understand and
 *       correctly implement XPath pointers. Note that the {@link Feature} object does not
 *       understand XPath at all and relies on implementors of this interface to interpret
 *       XPath references. Fortunately, XPath is quite simple and has a clearly written
 *       <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath">specification</a>.</p></li>
 *
 *   <li><p><b>Feature Creation</b><br>
 *       {@code FeatureType} also must provide methods for the creation of {@link Feature}s.
 *       The creating {@code FeatureType} should check to see if the passed in objects validate
 *       against its attribute types, and if it does should return a new feature.</p></li>
 * </ul>
