/**
 * Fefines a constraint that can be checked against an instance of an Object (usually a Feature).
 * <p>
 * Often a filter is used to to define a set {@linkplain Feature feature} instances
 * that are to be operated upon. The operating set can be comprised of one or more
 * enumerated features or a set of features defined by specifying spatial and
 * non-spatial constraints on the geometric and scalar properties of a feature type.
 * <p>
 * Roughly speaking, a filter encodes the information present in the {@code WHERE}
 * clause of a SQL statement.  There are various subclasses of this class that
 * implement many types of filters, such as simple property comparisons or spatial
 * queries.
 * <p>
 * The second use of Filter focuses on expressing constraints (or Facets). This use
 * places restrictions on the allowable and is captured as part of schema information
 * (@linkplain FeatureType). This is similar to the XML concept of "facets".
 * </p>
