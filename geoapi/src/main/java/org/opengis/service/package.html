The following is adapted from
<A HREF="http://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=1221">OpenGIS&reg; Service Architecture (Topic 12)</A>
specification.

<P ALIGN="justify">The widespread application of computers and use of geographic information systems (GIS) have led
to the increased analysis of geographic data within multiple disciplines. Based on advances in information technology,
society’s reliance on such data is growing. Geographic datasets are increasingly being shared, exchanged, and used for
purposes other than their producers’ intended ones. GIS, remote sensing, automated mapping and facilities management
(AM/FM), traffic analysis, geopositioning systems, and other technologies for Geographic Information (GI) are entering a
period of radical integration.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">This International Standard provides a framework for developers to create software that enables
users to access and process geographic data from a variety of sources across a generic computing interface within an
open information technology environment.
<ul>
  <li>“a framework for developers” means this International Standard is based on a comprehensive, common (i.e.,
  formed by consensus for general use) plan for interoperable geoprocessing.</li>
  <li>“access and process” means that geodata users can query remote databases and control remote processing
  resources, and also take advantage of other distributed computing technologies such as software delivered to the
  user's local environment from a remote environment for temporary use.</li>
  <li>“from a variety of sources” means that users will have access to data acquired in a variety of ways and
  stored in a wide variety of relational and non-relational databases.</li>
  <li>“across a generic computing interface” means that ISO 19119 interfaces provide reliable communication between
  otherwise disparate software resources that are equipped to use these interfaces.</li>
  <li>“within an open information technology environment” means that this Standard enables geoprocessing to take
  place outside of the closed environment of monolithic GIS, remote sensing, and AM/FM systems that control and restrict
  database, user interface, network, and data manipulation functions.</li>
</ul>
</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">The scope of this International Standard is as follows: Identification and definition of the
architecture patterns for service interfaces used for geographic information and definition of the relationships to the
Open Systems Environment model. This International Standard presents a geographic services taxonomy and a list of
example geographic services placed in the services taxonomy. This International Standard prescribes how to create a
platform-neutral service specification, and how to derive platform-specific service specifications that are conformant
with this. This International Standard provides guidelines for the selection and specification of geographic services
from both platform-neutral and platform-specific perspectives.</P>
