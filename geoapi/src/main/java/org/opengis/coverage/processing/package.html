  {@linkplain org.opengis.coverage.processing.GridCoverageProcessor Grid coverage processor}
  (image processing functionality). The following is adapted from
  <A HREF="http://www.opengis.org/docs/01-004.pdf">OpenGIS&reg;
  Grid Coverages Implementation Specification</A>.

  <P ALIGN="justify">The following are examples of grid coverage processing operations.
  This list is not an exhaustive list. Different {@link org.opengis.coverage.processing.GridCoverageProcessor}
  implementations will provide different operations and need not implement the entire list below.</P>

  <P ALIGN="justify">Using one of these operations to change the way the grid is being accessed
  will not affect the state of the grid coverage controlled by another operations. For example,
  changing the interpolation method should not affect the number of sample dimensions currently
  being accessed or value sequence.</P>

      <A HREF="http://www.opengis.org/docs/01-004.pdf">Grid Coverages Implementation specification 1.0</A>.
      We plan to replace it by new interfaces derived from ISO 19123 (<CITE>Schema for coverage geometry
      and functions</CITE>). Current interfaces should be considered as legacy and are included in this
      distribution only because they were part of GeoAPI 1.0 release. We will try to preserve as much 
      compatibility as possible, but no migration plan has been determined yet.</P>
