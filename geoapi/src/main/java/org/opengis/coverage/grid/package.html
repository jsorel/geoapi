  {@linkplain org.opengis.coverage.grid.GridCoverage Grid coverages} (coverages with gridded data).
  The following is adapted from
  <A HREF="http://www.opengis.org/docs/01-004.pdf">OpenGIS&reg;
  Grid Coverages Implementation Specification</A>.

  <P ALIGN="justify">This Grid Coverage Implementation specification can accommodate grid
  coverages with the following characteristics:</P>
  <UL>
    <LI>Variable number of bits per grid value (bits per pixel): 
        1, 2, 4 unsigned integer;
        8, 16, 32 signed and unsigned integer;
        32, 64 real numbers.</LI>
    <LI>1 to <VAR>N</VAR> number of bands.</LI>
    <LI>1 to <VAR>N</VAR> dimensions.</LI>
    <LI>For grids with multiple bands, band values can be ordered by dimension.
        For example, a 2D grid coverage can be ordered row, column, band (pixel interleaved),
        row, band, column (line interleaved) or band, row, column (band sequential).</LI>
    <LI>Support for a variable number of "no data values".</LI>
    <LI>Various color models: Gray Scale, pseudo color (any size), RGB, CMYK and HSL.</LI>
    <LI>Support of overviews or pyramids (reduced resolution data sets).</LI>
  </UL>

  <H2>Grid Coordinate System</H2>
  <P ALIGN="justify">A grid coverage has a grid coordinate reference system which allows for
  addressing individual cells in the grid. Individual cells are centered on the grid points.
  A grid has an ordering of cell values with the first cell in this ordering having a grid
  coordinate of 0,0. A two dimensional grid coverage with 512 rows and 512 columns would have
  grid coordinates with a range from 0 to 511 rows and 0 to 511 columns. The gridRange attribute
  {@link org.opengis.coverage.grid.GridGeometry} structure defines the grid coordinate range. The number of
  cells in a dimension of the grid can be calculated as grid range
  <VAR>maximum</VAR> – <VAR>minimum</VAR>.</P>

  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <H2>Grid Coverage Tiling</H2>
  <P ALIGN="justify">This implementation specification has no explicit interfaces to retrieve
  data values from a grid coverage in tiles. It is expected that the implementation will
  efficiently retrieve data values when the client implementation retrieves data values on
  tile boundaries. The optimal size to access a dimension can be determined from the
  {@link org.opengis.coverage.grid.GridCoverage#getOptimalDataBlockSizes optimalDataBlockSizes} attribute.</P>

  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <H2>Interoperability</H2>
  <P ALIGN="justify">To help interoperability, many interfaces contained in this architecture
  have been made immutable. The assumption is that the objects supporting these interfaces
  should be immutable. This means that the objects should not change after a factory has
  created them. In particular, the following interfaces are assumed to be backed by immutable
  objects: {@link org.opengis.coverage.SampleDimension}, {@link org.opengis.coverage.grid.Format},
  {@link org.opengis.coverage.grid.GridCoverageExchange}, {@link org.opengis.coverage.processing.Operation},
  {@link org.opengis.coverage.processing.GridAnalysis}, {@link org.opengis.coverage.processing.GridCoverageProcessor}.</P>

  <P ALIGN="justify">In a {@link org.opengis.coverage.grid.GridCoverage}, only the cell values may change.
  The size, geometry, interpolation, sequencing etc should never change. However, clients should
  be aware that the Grid Coverage object behind the {@link org.opengis.coverage.grid.GridCoverage} interface
  may be adapted from other {@link org.opengis.coverage.grid.GridCoverage} interfaces, so changing the grid
  point (pixel) values through one {@link org.opengis.coverage.grid.GridCoverage} could change the grid point
  values in others. To allow client applications to anticipate adapted Grid Coverages being changed
  indirectly, the source Grid Geometry object(s) for adapted Grid Geometry objects can be traced.</P>

      <P align="justify"><STRONG>WARNING: THIS PACKAGE WILL CHANGE.</STRONG> Current API is derived from OGC
      <A HREF="http://www.opengis.org/docs/01-004.pdf">Grid Coverages Implementation specification 1.0</A>.
      We plan to replace it by new interfaces derived from ISO 19123 (<CITE>Schema for coverage geometry
      and functions</CITE>). Current interfaces should be considered as legacy and are included in this
      distribution only because they were part of GeoAPI 1.0 release. We will try to preserve as much 
      compatibility as possible, but no migration plan has been determined yet.</P>
