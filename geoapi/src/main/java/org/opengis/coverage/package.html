  {@linkplain org.opengis.coverage.Coverage Coverages} (generate a value for any point). The following is adapted from
  <A HREF="http://www.opengis.org/docs/01-004.pdf">OpenGIS&reg; Grid Coverages Implementation Specification</A>.

  <P ALIGN="justify">The architecture of the grid coverage specification is composed of three
  packages. The specification includes a package for the general coverage specification,
  a package specifically for grid coverages and a package for grid coverage processing.
  The processing package is optional and not required for an OGC compliant implementation.</P>

  <P ALIGN="justify">The essential property of coverage is to be able
  to generate a value for any point within its domain. How coverage is
  represented internally is not a concern. For example consider the
  following different internal representations of coverage:</P>

  <OL>
    <LI>A coverage may be represented by a set of polygons which exhaustively
        tile a plane (that is each point on the plane falls in precisely one
        polygon). The value returned by the coverage for a point is the value
        of an attribute of the polygon that contains the point.<BR>&nbsp;</LI>
    <LI>A coverage may be represented by a grid of values. The value returned
        by the coverage for a point is that of the grid value whose location
        is nearest the point.<BR>&nbsp;</LI>
    <LI>Coverage may be represented by a mathematical function. The value
        returned by the coverage for a point is just the return value of the
        function when supplied the coordinates of the point as arguments.<BR>&nbsp;</LI>
    <LI>Coverage may be represented by combination of these. For example,
        coverage may be represented by a combination of mathematical functions
        valid over a set of polynomials.</LI>
  </OL>

  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <H2>Color Palettes</H2>
  <P ALIGN="justify">A coverage can have a color palette. A color palette is valid for only
  coverages which are integer values (usually bytes). Color palettes supported include gray
  scale, RGB, HLS and CMYK. The coverage dimension information maps the grid sample dimensions
  to a color palette or to color model components. For example 8-bit pseudo color TIFF image
  would be represented as a grid with one sample dimension and a color palette with 256 RGB
  entries. A 24-bit RGB TIFF file would be represented as a grid with three bands and no color
  palette. The dimension information would indicate which bands to use for the RGB color components.
  The following illustrates example values for different color components:</P>

  <TABLE CELLPADDING='6'>
    <TR><TD NOWRAP BGCOLOR='lightgray'>{@linkplain org.opengis.coverage.PaletteInterpretation#GRAY Gray Scale}</TD>
    <TD>Vector contains one entry which a shade of gray. 0 is black and 255 is white.</TD></TR>

    <TR><TD NOWRAP BGCOLOR='lightgray'>{@linkplain org.opengis.coverage.PaletteInterpretation#RGB RGB}</TD>
    <TD>Vector contains three values: Red Green Blue. Each value ranges from 0 to 255
        where 0 is no intensity and 255 is maximum intensity.</TD></TR>

    <TR><TD NOWRAP BGCOLOR='lightgray'>{@linkplain org.opengis.coverage.PaletteInterpretation#RGB RGBA}</TD>
    <TD>Vector contains four values RGBA: Red Green Blue Alpha. The alpha value is the
        level of transparency of the color. Alpha of 0 is transparent and 255 is opaque.</TD></TR>

    <TR><TD NOWRAP BGCOLOR='lightgray'>{@linkplain org.opengis.coverage.PaletteInterpretation#HLS HLS}</TD>
    <TD>Vector contains three values: Hue Saturation Lightness. Hue is a value from 0 to
        360. Saturation is a value from 0 to 100 where 0 is no color intensity and 100 is
        full color intensity. Lightness is a value from 0 to 100 where 0 is no lightness
        and 100 is full lightness.</TD></TR>

    <TR><TD NOWRAP BGCOLOR='lightgray'>{@linkplain org.opengis.coverage.PaletteInterpretation#CMYK CMYK}</TD>
    <TD>Vector contains four values: Cyan Magenta Yellow Black. Each value ranges from
        0 to 255 where 0 is no intensity and 255 is maximum intensity.</TD></TR>

      <A HREF="http://www.opengis.org/docs/01-004.pdf">Grid Coverages Implementation specification 1.0</A>.
      We plan to replace it by new interfaces derived from ISO 19123 (<CITE>Schema for coverage geometry
      and functions</CITE>). Current interfaces should be considered as legacy and are included in this
      distribution only because they were part of GeoAPI 1.0 release. We will try to preserve as much 
      compatibility as possible, but no migration plan has been determined yet.</P>
