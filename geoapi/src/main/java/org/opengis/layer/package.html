    Basic unit of geographic information that may be requested as a map from a server. The following is
    adapted from <A HREF="http://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=5316">Web Map Service</A>:

    <P ALIGN="justify">Each available map is advertised by a {@link org.opengis.layer.Layer} element in
    the service metadata. Conceptually, each Layer is a distinct entity. However, as a means of classifying
    and organizing layers, and as a means of reducing the size of the service metadata, a single parent Layer
    may enclose any number of additional layers, which may be hierarchically nested as desired. Some properties
    defined in a parent layer are inherited by the children it encloses. These inherited properties may be either
    redefined or added to by the child.</P>
    
    <P ALIGN="justify">A Map Server shall include at least one {@link org.opengis.layer.Layer} element for each
    map layer offered. If desired, layers may be repeated in different categories (i.e., enclosed in more than one
    parent {@code Layer}) when relevant.</P>
    
    <P ALIGN="justify">A list of keywords or keyword phrases describing each layer should be included to help catalogue
    searching. Each keyword may be accompanied by a "vocabulary" attribute to indicate the defining authority for the
    keyword. No controlled vocabulary of Layer and Style Names or Titles is defined by the International Standard, so
    they may be chosen at the discretion of the service provider organization or information community.</P>

    <H3>Scale denominators</H3>
    <P ALIGN="justify">The {@linkplain org.opengis.layer.Layer#getMinScaleDenominator minimum scale denominator} and
    {@linkplain org.opengis.layer#getMaxScaleDenominator maximum scale denominator} elements define the range of scales
    for which it is appropriate to generate a map of a {@linkplain org.opengis.layer.Layer layer}. Because maps from a
    Web Map Service may be viewed on arbitrary displays rather than on paper, the values used are actually the scale
    denominators relative to a common display pixel size. The intent of scale denominators is not the translation between
    "actual" and "standard" scales always be completely accurate. Rather, the intent is to reduce the amount of clutter or
    crowding of features portrayed on the map. The scale denominator values are guidelines for clients, not firm limits.
    Upon receiving a request for a map that is not within the scale denominator range, the server may return a blank map,
    or may return a portrayal of the layer that is crowded with features or otherwise poorly suited for display; the server
    shall not respond with a service exception.</P>

    <P ALIGN="justify">For the purposes of the ISO 19128 International Standard, the common pixel size is defined to be
    0.28mm &times; 0.28mm (millimetres). Because arbitrary clients can request maps from a server, the true pixel size
    of the final rendering device is unknown to the server.</P>

    <P ALIGN="justify">Because it is possible to integrate the output of multiple Web Map Servers into a single displayed
    result, it is important that different servers have consistent behaviour with respect to processing scales, so that all
    of the independent servers will select or deselect layers at the same scales. To ensure consistent behaviour, scales
    relative to coordinate spaces must be handled consistently between map servers. For geographic coordinate systems, which
    use angular units, the angular coverage of a map shall be converted to linear units for computation of scale by using the
    circumference of the Earth at the equator and by assuming perfectly square linear units. For linear coordinate systems, the
    size of the coordinate space should be used directly without compensating for distortions in it with respect to the shape
    of the real Earth.</P>

    <P ALIGN="justify">Floating-point roundoff-error control should also be applied to these calculations, to ensure consistency
    between systems. Because the scale denominators used in {@linkplain org.opengis.layer.Layer} metadata will often be "round"
    numbers, such as 250000, if a calculation of the current scale results in a value of 249999.99999999, it should be considered
    to match 250000.</P>
