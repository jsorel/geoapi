/**
 * Describes how a ComplexType may be composed of types, associations and
 * operations.
 * <p>
 * Name and Type need to be defined in most cases.
 * <p>
 * <h2>Naming</h2>
 * <p>
 * Since a descriptor is defined with respect to a ComplexAttribute you can use
 * the provided name to lookup a descriptor at runtime. The name however belongs
 * to a namespace that may have no relationship with the containing ComplexType,
 * so please be sure
 * </p>
 * 
 * <h2>Note on Use of User Data</h2>
 * </p>
 * User Data is used to allow additional "temporary" metadata to be associated
 * with attributes descriptors in order to facilitiate procesing services. These
 * services traditionally setting up "shadow" structures such as a HashMap.
 * Allowing non persisted bread crumbs is considered preferable.
