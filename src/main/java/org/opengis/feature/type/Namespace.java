/**
 * A collection of 0 or more {@linkplain Name names}, with no duplicates.
 * <p>
 * If this was not an interface only project we could make use of the
 * javax.naming package As such we recommend storing your
 * Namespace instances in a JNDI according to their URI.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The ISO 19103 specification asks that we have:
 * <ul>
 * <li>isGlobal()
 * <li>name() - inidicating the name of this namespace
 * <li>getNames() - set of names
 * </ul>
 * We have combined these concerns by making this a Set of Names,
 * and we remember the URI of this namespace.
 * <p>
 * One allowance ISO_19103 allows for is having a Namespace located inside another
 * namespace. You may certaintly do this by constructing a facility similar to Schema
 * in which namespaces may be looked up via a Name with the same URI as the one
 * used here.
 * <p>
 * We are simply not dictating the lookup mechanism, or a backpointer to
 * a containing namespace (note the two solutions are in conflict and we would like
 * to offer application the freedom to back this interface onto a facility such as
 * JNDI used in their own application).
