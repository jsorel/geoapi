/**
 * Association information, immutable.
 * <p>
 * The model must recognize the following specific Association types:
 * <ul>
 * <li>aggregation
 * <li>spatial
 * <li>temporal
 * </ul>
 * Note that as usual multiplicity is left for the AssociationDescriptor, this class
 * is used to capture relationships between types.
 * <p>
 * Note: I am treating the domain of the association type similar to that of Attribute
 * Type, the intention is to indicate the relationship that a FeatureCollection has
 * with its contents (specifically a memberOf).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Care should be taken with associations, keep the aggregation, spatial, temporal goal in mind:
 * <ul>
 * <li>aggregation: a university may contain the buildings
 * <li>spatial: "touches" the current feature would be used in a graph package
 * <li>temporal: "before" the current feature would be used in a versioning system
 * </ul>
 * You should not use Associations to capture information such as "super" as this
 * represents a relationship of abstractions used to define a type, with associations we are
 * aiming to let you describe how the types in your system are related.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You may gather associations into a hierarchy and refine where needed, thus a lake could be
 * associated with "connected" rivers, and thus refined with "up stream" and "down stream".
