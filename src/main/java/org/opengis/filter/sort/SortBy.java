/**
 * Defines the sort order, based on a property and assending/desending.
 * <p>
 * Having SortBy at the Filter level is an interesting undertaking of Filter 1.1
 * support. Why you ask? It is at the Same level as Filter, it is not *used* by
 * Filter itself. The services that make use of Filter, such as WFS are starting
 * to make use of SortBy in the same breath.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Where is SortBy used:
 * <ul>
 * <li>WFS 1.1 Query
 * <li>CSW 2.0.1 AbstractQuery
 * </ul>
 * There may be more ...
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * What this means is that the GeoTools Query will make use of this
 * construct. As for sorting the result of an expression (where an
 * expression matches more then one element), we will splice it in to
 * AttributeExpression as an optional parameter. Note function is defined
 * to return a single value (so we don't need to worry there).
 * </p> 
 * @see <a href="http://schemas.opengis.net/filter/1.1.0/sort.xsd">
 * @see <a href="http://schemas.opengis.net/wfs/1.1.0/wfs.xsd">

 * @since GeoTools 2.2, Filter 1.1
