/**
 * Defines a common abstraction for graphic representation of polygons.  
 * A <code>GraphicPolygon</code> consists of a an exterior ring of vertices
 * and a set of non-mutually-overlapping interior rings of vertices.
 * The exterior and interior rings of a polygon are defined by a list of
 * {@linkplain DirectPosition} objects.  Technically speaking, these rings are
 * required to be closed (i.e. the first and last points must coincide).
 * However, this interface allows the user to create lists where the first and
 * last points are not coincident.  In such a case, the implementation of this
 * interface will assume that there is an additional segment between the first
 * and last points, completing the ring.  (This will take place without
 * modifying the list of points.)
