  {@linkplain org.opengis.referencing.crs.CoordinateReferenceSystem Coordinate reference systems}
  ({@linkplain org.opengis.referencing.cs.CoordinateSystem coordinate systems} with a
  {@linkplain org.opengis.referencing.datum.Datum datum}). The following is adapted from
  <A HREF="http://www.opengis.org/docs/03-073r1.zip">OpenGIS&reg;
  Spatial Referencing by Coordinates (Topic 2)</A> specification.

  <P ALIGN="justify">A coordinate reference system consists of one coordinate
  system that is related to the earth through one datum. The coordinate system
  is composed of a set of coordinate axes with specified units of measure. This
  concept implies the mathematical rules that define how coordinate values are
  calculated from distances, angles and other geometric elements and vice versa.
  A datum specifies the relationship of a coordinate system to the earth, thus
  ensuring that the abstract mathematical concept "coordinate system" can be
  applied to the practical problem of describing positions of features on or
  near the earth's surface by means of coordinates. The resulting combination
  of coordinate system and datum is a coordinate reference system. Each datum
  subtype can be associated with only specific types of coordinate systems. The
  datum implicitly (occasionally explicitly) contains the values chosen for the
  set parameters that represent the degrees of freedom of the coordinate system.
  A datum therefore implies a choice regarding the approximate origin and
  orientation of the coordinate system.</P>
  
  <P ALIGN="justify">For the purposes of this specification, a coordinate
  reference system shall not change with time, with the exception of engineering
  coordinate reference systems defined on moving platforms such as cars, ships,
  aircraft and spacecraft. The intention is to exclude the option to describe
  the time variability of geodetic coordinate reference systems as a result of
  e.g. tectonic motion. This variability is part of the subject matter of geophysical
  and geodetic science. The model for spatial referencing by coordinates described
  in this specification is in principle not suitable for such zero-order geodetic
  problems. Such time-variability of coordinate reference systems shall be covered
  in the spatial referencing model described in this specification by creating
  different coordinate reference systems, each with a different datum, for
  (consecutive) epochs. The date of realisation of the datum shall then be
  included in its definition. It is further recommended to include the date of
  realisation in the names of those datums and coordinate reference systems.</P>

  <H3>Principal sub-types of coordinate reference system</H3>
  <P ALIGN="justify">Geodetic survey practice usually divides coordinate
  reference systems into a number of sub-types. The common classification
  criterion for sub-typing of coordinate reference systems can be described
  as the way in which they deal with earth curvature. This has a direct effect
  on the portion of the earth's surface that can be covered by that type of CRS
  with an acceptable degree of error. Thus the following principal sub-types of
  coordinate reference system are distinguished:</P>

  <BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P ALIGN="justify"><STRONG>Geocentric</STRONG>:
  Type of coordinate reference system that deals with the earth's curvature
  by taking the 3D spatial view, which obviates the need to model the earth's
  curvature. The origin of a geocentric CRS is at the approximate centre of
  mass of the earth.</P>

  <P ALIGN="justify"><STRONG>Geographic</STRONG>:
  Type of coordinate reference system based on an ellipsoidal approximation of
  the geoid. This provides an accurate representation of the geometry of geographic
  features for a large portion of the earth's surface. Geographic coordinate reference
  systems can be 2D or 3D. A 2D Geographic CRS is used when positions of features are
  described on the surface of the reference ellipsoid; a 3D Geographic CRS is used when
  positions are described on, above or below the reference ellipsoid.</P>

  <P ALIGN="justify"><STRONG>Projected</STRONG>:
  Type of coordinate reference system that is based on an approximation of the
  shape of the earth's surface by a plane. The distortion that is inherent to the
  approximation is carefully controlled and known. Distortion correction is commonly
  applied to calculated bearings and distances to produce values that are a close
  match to actual field values.</P>

  <P ALIGN="justify"><STRONG>Engineering</STRONG>:
  Type of coordinate reference system that is that is used only in a contextually
  local sense. This sub-type is used to model two broad categories of local
  coordinate reference systems:</P>
  <UL>
    <LI>earth-fixed systems, applied to engineering activities on or near the
        surface of the earth;</LI>
    <LI>coordinates on moving platforms such as road vehicles, vessels, aircraft
        or spacecraft.</LI>
  </UL>
  <P ALIGN="justify">Earth-fixed Engineering CRSs are commonly based on a simple
  flat-earth approximation of the earth's surface, and the effect of earth curvature
  on feature geometry is ignored: calculations on coordinates use simple plane arithmetic
  without any corrections for earth curvature. The application of such Engineering CRSs to
  relatively small areas and "contextually local" is in this case equivalent to
  "spatially local". Engineering CRSs used on moving platforms are usually intermediate
  coordinate reference systems that are computationally required to calculate geodetic
  coordinates. These coordinate reference systems are subject to all the motions of the
  platform with which they are associated. In this case "contextually local" means that
  the associated coordinates are meaningful only relative to the moving platform. Earth
  curvature is usually irrelevant and is therefore ignored. In the spatial sense their
  applicability may extend from the immediate vicinity of the platform (e.g. a moving
  seismic ship) to the entire earth (e.g. in space applications). The determining factor
  is the mathematical model deployed in the positioning calculations. Transformation of
  coordinates from these moving Engineering CRSs to earth-referenced coordinate reference
  systems involves time-dependent coordinate operation parameters, which can be modelled by
  the structures provided in this UML model.</P>

  <P ALIGN="justify"><STRONG>Image</STRONG>:
  An Image CRS is an Engineering CRS applied to images. Image CRSs are treated as
  a separate sub-type because a separate user community exists for images with its
  own vocabulary. The definition of the associated Image Datum contains two data
  attributes not relevant for other datums and coordinate reference systems.</P>

  <P ALIGN="justify"><STRONG>Vertical</STRONG>:
  Type of coordinate reference system used for the recording of heights or depths.
  Vertical CRSs make use of the direction of gravity to define the concept of
  height or depth, but its relationship with gravity may not be straightforward.
  By implication ellipsoidal heights (h) cannot be captured in a vertical coordinate
  reference system. Ellipsoidal heights cannot exist independently, but only as
  inseparable part of a 3D coordinate tuple defined in a geographic 3D coordinate
  reference system.</P>

  <P ALIGN="justify"><STRONG>Temporal</STRONG>:
  Used for the recording of time in association with any of the listed spatial
  coordinate reference systems only.</P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>

  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <H3>Additional sub-types of coordinate reference system</H3>
  <P ALIGN="justify">In addition to the principal sub-types, so called because
  they represent concepts generally known in geodetic practice, two more sub-types
  have been defined to permit modelling of certain relationships and constraints
  that exist between the principal sub-types. These additional sub-types are
  <A HREF="#CompoundCRS">Compound coordinate reference system</A> and
  <A HREF="#DerivedCRS">Derived coordinate reference system</A>.</P>

  <BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P ALIGN="justify"><STRONG><A NAME="CompoundCRS">Compound coordinate reference system</A></STRONG><BR>
  The traditional separation of horizontal and vertical position has resulted in
  coordinate reference systems that are horizontal (2D) in nature and vertical (1D).
  It is established practice to combine the horizontal coordinates of a point with
  a height or depth from a different coordinate reference system. The coordinate
  reference system to which these 3D coordinates are referenced combines the separate
  horizontal and vertical coordinate reference systems of the horizontal and vertical
  coordinates. Such a coordinate system is called a compound coordinate reference
  system (Compound CRS). It consists of an ordered sequence of the two or more single
  coordinate reference systems.</P>
 
  <P ALIGN="justify">A Compound CRS is thus a coordinate reference system that
  combines two or more coordinate reference systems, none of which can itself be
  compound. In general, a Compound CRS may contain any number of axes. The Compound CRS
  contains an ordered set of coordinate reference systems and the tuple order of a compound
  coordinate set shall follow that order, while the subsets of the tuple, described by each
  of the composing coordinate reference systems, follow the tuple order valid for their
  respective coordinate reference systems.</P>

  <P ALIGN="justify">For spatial coordinates, a number of constraints exist for
  the construction of Compound CRSs. For example, the coordinate reference systems
  that are combined should not contain any duplicate or redundant axes. Valid
  combinations include:</P>

  <UL>
    <LI>Geographic 2D + Vertical</LI>
    <LI>Geographic 2D + Engineering 1D (near vertical)</LI>
    <LI>Projected + Vertical</LI>
    <LI>Projected + Engineering 1D (near vertical)</LI>
    <LI>Engineering (horizontal 2D or 1D linear) + Vertical</LI>
  </UL>

  <P ALIGN="justify">Any coordinate reference system, or any of the above listed
  combinations of coordinate reference systems, can have a Temporal CRS added.
  More than one Temporal CRS may be added if these axes represent different time
  quantities. For example, the oil industry sometimes uses "4D seismic", by which
  is meant seismic data with the vertical axis expressed in milliseconds (signal
  travel time). A second time axis indicates how it changes with time (years),
  e.g. as a reservoir is gradually exhausted of its recoverable oil or gas).</P>

  <P ALIGN="justify"><STRONG><A NAME="DerivedCRS">Derived coordinate reference system</A></STRONG><BR>
  Some coordinate reference systems are defined by applying a coordinate conversion to
  another coordinate reference system. Such a coordinate reference system is called a
  Derived CRS and the coordinate reference system it was derived from by applying the
  conversion is called the Source or Base CRS. A coordinate conversion is an arithmetic
  operation with zero or more parameters that have defined values. The Source CRS and
  Derived CRS have the same Datum. The best-known example of a Derived CRS is a
  Projected CRS, which is always derived from a source Geographic CRS by applying the
  coordinate conversion known as a map projection.</P>

  <P ALIGN="justify">In principle, all sub-types of coordinate reference system may
  take on the role of either Source or Derived CRS with the exception of a Geocentric
  CRS and a Projected CRS. The latter is modelled as an object class under its own name,
  rather than as a general Derived CRS of type "projected". This has been done to honour
  common practice, which acknowledges Projected CRSs as one of the best known types of
  coordinate reference systems.</P>

  <P ALIGN="justify">An example of a Derived CRS:
  one of which the unit of measure has been modified with respect to an earlier
  defined Geographic CRS, which then takes the role of Source CRS.</P>
