OpenOffice.org add-in download

  The GeoAPI add-in is provided for demonstration purpose only. It is provided mostly as a <proof
  of concept> and as a starting point for implementors. Users should consider using an alternative
  implementation instead, which will typically be easier to install (no native library) and provide
  more functionalities.


* GeoAPI demo (require native Proj.4 library)

  * {{{http://jenkins.geotoolkit.org/job/GeoAPI/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/trunk/geoapi-openoffice/target/geoapi-3.1-SNAPSHOT.oxt}Development snapshot}}



* Other implementations (pure Java)

  * {{{http://www.geotoolkit.org/modules/analytics/geotk-openoffice/index.html}Geotoolkit.org add-in for OpenOffice.org}}



* Demo spreadsheets

  The following files can be opened in OpenOffice.org after the demo add-in, or an alternative
  implementation listed above, has been installed:
