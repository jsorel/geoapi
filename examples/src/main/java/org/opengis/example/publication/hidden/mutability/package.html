In order to "hide" mutability (ie only the application can edit against its known implementations) we need to be sure that it correctly isolates the "public" (or published) GeoAPI interface from all synchronization issues.
<ul>
<li>GeoAPI interface is public or published (and read-only)</li>
<li>Application implementation is private and read-write</li>
</ul>
