/**
 * The query object is used by the {@link DataStore#getFeatures(Query)} method
 * of the DataStore interface, to encapsulate a request.  It defines which
 * feature type to query, what properties to retrieve and what constraints
 * (spatial and non-spatial) to apply to those properties.  It is designed to
 * closesly match a WFS Query element of a <code>getFeatures</code> request.
 * The only difference is the addition of the maxFeatures element, which
 * allows more control over the features selected.  It allows a full
 * <code>getFeatures</code> request to properly control how many features it
 * gets from each query, instead of requesting and discarding when the max is
 * reached.
